# Learning CouchDB

I wanted to learn some CouchDB. This is part of the progress that i documented for:

* Reviewing what i did and how.
* Presenting it to other people.
* Creating something like a cheat-sheet.


## Preparation

You need:

1. A couchdb installation:
    `sudo apt-get install couchdb` should work,
    http://couchdb.apache.org/ use the newest version.
2. For the scripts PHP5 will be needed:
    `sudo apt-get install php5-cli`


## Presentation

Simply run each of the files starting with a number, and have a look what will be printed on the screen.



## CheatSheet

1. PHPMyAdmin is "Futon"

Go to http://localhost:5984/_utils/ and have a look around.

2. Fix Admin-Party

By default each CouchDB Server will allow everybody everything, even restarts and dropping databases.
You can fix this in "Futon" in the lower right corner.
